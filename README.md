the home is where u start of  from there ucan navigate arounfd using the help logo feture  on the top left corner i would have had another link in there but to lack of timing i cannot add the register link wer they would have been able to sign up.

- __The home page__

  the home page consisits of the nav bar, the logo link in the nav bar, a video and footer, this the main page and the purpose is to inform you of how change can be made through the video and more information i would have provided but wasnt able due to loss of tim and lack of experience using git pod and others.

  there is a main logo for the web page on the background and a video informing how some one had turnt themselves around and how you yourself are the oly limit to your possibilities.
   i would have centered the video and had it alot smaller but due to lack of time im having to go ahead.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
